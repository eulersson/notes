A very solid approach is laid down in the [[Manual of Standard Tibetan]] in the Appendix 7.

For people who don't have the book I can see they collected this in the [[The Tibetan & Himalayan Library]] under [[THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription of Standard Tibetan]]

## Summary

The correspondence between Tibetan letters and Wylie letters is the exact same except for ཅ་ which is *cha* instead of *ca*, and འ which we write as *a* instead of *'a*.

**Superscribed** letters (ར་ ལ་ ས་) fall down and disappear during transcription. and so do **prefixes** (ག་ ད་ བ་ མ་ འ་) and silent **suffixes** (ས་ ད་). 

But some **superscribed** letters or **prefixes** (specially when not at beginning of word) sometimes they can be pronounced so we transliterate them in, such as བློ་བཟང་ "Lo**b**sang" or རྡོ་རྗེ་ "Dorje". So that leads to the question: *33. Transcribing Tibetan Words When does the prefix letter sound?* in [Tibetan Language Questions Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wGcCFSY7tffI8tl-jIMJHfIju-8MMrIcRoOmYtEOwR0/edit?usp=sharing). 

Vowels *a*, *o*, *u* followed by ད་ ན་ ལ་ ས་ acquire umlaut *ä*, *ö*, *ü*.

> [!note]
> I personally will do what many people commonly do to avoid umlaut in **ä** they approximate it to **e**, so instead of Jampäl they write Jampel or Thubten instead of Thubtan.

Suffixes ག་ བ་ get devoiced as *k*, *p*.

བ་ at second syllable of word is *wa*.

པྱ་ *cha*, ཕྱ *cha*, བྱ *ja*.

About ར་-attached clusters: *tr*, *thr*, *dr*.

Voiced radicals ག་ ཇ་ ད་ བ་ ཛ་ or a cluster གྱ་ བྱ་ without the prefix that causes aspiration loss is transcribed as *gh*, *jh*, *dh*, *bha*, *dzh*, *ghy*, *jh*.

དབྲ་ *r*, དབྱ་ *y*, དབ་ *w*.
