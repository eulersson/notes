This document collects observations, questions, and small write-ups (sometimes in Tibetan) about the journey of learning Tibetan. It's quite personal, so the diary will be about my daily life and don't expect it to be exciting considering the beginner stage I am still at ðŸ˜†. It's more for people that have similar level to see my struggles or realizations.

> [!INFO] Language Questions
> As Tibetan language questions arise arise I write them on this shared (with other class mates and course staff) [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wGcCFSY7tffI8tl-jIMJHfIju-8MMrIcRoOmYtEOwR0/edit?usp=sharing) and you are welcome do contribute by adding more or answering them. If you see a ðŸ¤” in this document it also expresses doubt and needs to be checked with #tutor.

>[!TODO] Daily Tasks
> This is my aim (even 10 minutes of each thing is fine):
> - [ ] **Vocabulary**: Anki flashcard decks.
> - [ ] **Listening**: Dialogs from the book, or [Esukhia](https://esukhia.online/) audio children stories, or YouTube A0/A1-level tracks.
> - [ ] **Reading**: Anything, even if I don't understand. à½‘à½”à½ºà¼‹à½†à¼‹, children book, or à½¦à¾¦à¾±à½¼à½¢à¼‹à½€à¾³à½¼à½‚ (spelling).
> - [ ] **Speaking + Writing**: Video Record Explaining Day + Transcript Analysis
> - [ ] **Questions**: Transfer #to-questions-doc marked questions to [Tibetan Language Questions Google Shared Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wGcCFSY7tffI8tl-jIMJHfIju-8MMrIcRoOmYtEOwR0) so everyone benefits.
