> My Garden (tsal) of Thoughts (sampa) | Ramon's Notes and Reflections".

At the moment this is quite empty. Use the left sidebar (three horizontal line) or start from the #tibetan tag. As time goes on hopefully you will see ideas or texts I want to share with the world:
- Reflections
- Notes about teaching
- Technical write-ups
- Workflows and productivity hacks
- Psychology
- Buddhism and Tibetan language
- Travel guides and local information
- Sources of inspiration
- Drawings or creativity

All those from a personal stand-point... I don't want to repeat what Wikipedia says or what that other book says, unless I find value to summarise it!

At the moment I am crafting some classes for Grade 1 monks at a monastery, which you can check in [[Reflection on Teaching English as Second Language]].
