		1. But... The monk said something before the subject... Something that I asked and he said it means "if". So it seems there's an explicit word to use to say "if"?

This is the context I introduced under *Settings > Preferences*:
> Every time I ask you to translate from Tibetan always give to me in Colloquial Style, not literary.
> Tibetan translations always separating words with spaces because I am learning and that way I can see where one word ends and other starts.
> When transcribing Tibetan phonetically always use Lotsawa House style, that is: space between words so words can be identified, and using "é" instead of "ey". Claude mostly by default does this already.
> When asking for breakdowns, between parenthesis don't give me the Wylie transliteration, instead give me the one I mentioned in the preferences, just on the previous sentence. Make sure to honour the requirement of not having space inbetween the same word.
