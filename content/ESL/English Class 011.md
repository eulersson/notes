## 1. Exam (15 min)
Let's do it differently now. Students write to their notebooks, and then after doing 10 verbs and 10 prepositions the teachers marks them individually.

| Set          | Way  | Points |     |
| ------------ | ---- | ------ | --- |
| Verbs        | Type | > 13   |     |
| Prepositions | Type | > 13   |     |

## 1. Introducing Themselves
### Explain (10 min)
Bring in the same whiteboard text from last class, or simply project it.

![[Introducing Yourself Small Dialog]]

### Activity: Small Dialog (20 min)
Get a student pair, they will get ==points== regardless of their performance.

They need to go through the entire dialog in the section above. It's OK if they read from the whiteboard.

When it comes to choosing the emotion or the action:
- **The emotion is acted by the teacher.** Then the student that replies needs to say it loud and act it.
- The action is whispered and written by the teacher in small whiteboard. Then the student acts and the person asking has to say **You are ...**.


## 2. How Are You (15 min)
They always say "I'm fine" when I ask "How are you.". Let's get them more ways to say they are well.

### Explain (10 min)
Write on the board and have them copy:
