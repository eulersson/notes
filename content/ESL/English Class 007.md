## 3. Review Body Parts (20 min)
### Activity: Touching Something With Body Part (21 min)
Play with 2 teams of 3 players each.

The active player must carry the ==balloon== attached to their body (e.g. wrist), that adds a visual element that's fun and entertaining to see.

The teacher will reveal four sentences like:

Touch a bell with your ear
Touch a table with your nose
Touch a pillow with your finger
Touch a book with your left hand


And one by one the students need to perform these actions while the teacher **keeps track of time**.

The winner is the team that finished them the fastest. If no winner then the team who completed more actions wins.

Elements to play with:
- Classroom items: pen, pencil, floor, whiteboard, door, desk, chair, book, curtain, window, tv, computer, ...
- Body parts: head, finger, hand, feet, elbow, knee, ...
