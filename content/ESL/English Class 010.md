## Learning Goals
- Prepositions
- Introducing themselves

## Material
- 25 squared pieces of paper
- 4 drawings with many countable elements situated around different areas of the drawings.

---

## 1. Describing (Prepositions + Counting) (20 min)
Show 16 drawings one by one. Those drawings have countable items placed at certain areas on other objects so prepositions and counting at the same time can be practiced.

Two ways to do this exercise:
1. Teacher asks student "How many pens are on the table?"
2. Teacher prompts student to describe the image by making him produce the sentence! The student has to say "There are three pens on the table". And if they say "and there are..." then even greater!

### Activity: Asking Next Student (20 min)
By rolling a dice one student needs to ask that question to the student next to him. After the student replies, rolls the dice and go on.

> [!NOTE] Efficiency
> We can split the class in two so the other teacher could do the other half.
