## 1. Refresh Vocabulary (Anki) (20 min)
Since we start to have many words, speed up the process by speaking aloud instead of having the student to type.

Now we get more strict: if player gets more than 50% (roughly, make it clear before the exercise) of the words right, gets ==1 point==. We are not so benevolent as before, where only getting one spelling right gives you a point!

Also since I have 3 whiteboards available I will get three more students to do the test ==simultaneously==. It's important that they see the image but they don't see what the others are typing. As teacher, when the computer student reveals the result, I will mark the others with a âœ…. The rest of students type on their notebooks.

| Set        | Way         | Points         |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Animals    | Speak aloud | No             |
| Verbs      | Speak aloud | No             |
| Body parts | Type        | Yes if 3 right |
| Directions | Type        | Yes if 4 right |

## 2. Body Parts (20 min)

### Activity: Interactive Review (10 min)
**Set 1**, and **Set 2** in [Games to Learn English | Body Parts](https://www.gamestolearnenglish.com/body-parts/#review). First review them on screen, it's a nice interactive game!

Refresh the ones we know (arm, finger, knee, elbow, foot) and introduce new ones from **Set 1**, and **Set 2**:
- head
- body
- arm
- hand
- leg
- foot

Let's make a competition per each of those sets (**Set 1**, **Set 4**). For each set make 2 teams of 2 players each. You will play the game for **Set 1** with ==one team inside the room==, and then when finish write down the score in the whiteboard. Write the score on board. Afterwards, get the ==second team comes into the room== and will try to beat that score for **Set 1**. 

Give ==points== to the winning team members.

Then do the same for **Set 4**!

### Activity: Touching Something With Body Part (21 min)
Prepare two teams of 3 people each one. Say a sentence like "Touch the window with your arm.". One by one, the players need to do the actions, it can be ==marked with a balloon== (it's funny and it makes it visually more appealing). Player can discuss and help the active player. The team with most points wins.

Elements to play with: pen, pencil, floor, whiteboard, door, desk, chair, book, curtain, window, tv, computer, ...

> 21 minutes = 3 games of 7 minutes (each player gets 2 minutes).

### Activity: Placing Items Around (30 min)
Have two teams with 3 members. All team members can discuss together, but one player is the one who will perform the action. Active player can be marked with a balloon attached on him.

With the prepositions projected on screen, say sentences like "Put the pen inside the teacher's bag.". If the students miss vocabulary, draw the item in the whiteboard.
