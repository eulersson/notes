## 2. Class Room Item Vocabulary
Ask students "What is this?" with classroom items you see, they must reply "This is a \_\_\_". This is going to be useful for the upcoming exercises. Take a picture of the whiteboard and add those words in the Anki deck.

## 3. Review Body Parts (20 min)
### Activity: Touching Something With Body Part (21 min)
Play with 2 teams of 3 players each.

The active player must carry the ==balloon== attached to their body (e.g. wrist), that adds a visual element that's fun and entertaining to see.

The teacher will reveal four sentences like:
- Touch a pen with your left foot.
- Touch a window with your left foot.
- Touch a head with your nose. 
- Touch a whiteboard with a pen.

And one by one the students need to perform these actions while the teacher **keeps track of time**.

The winner is the team that finished them the fastest. If no winner then the team who completed more actions wins.

Elements to play with:
- Classroom items: pen, pencil, floor, whiteboard, door, desk, chair, book, curtain, window, tv, computer, ...
- Body parts: head, finger, hand, feet, elbow, knee, ...

> 21 minutes = 3 games of 7 minutes (each player gets 2 minutes).

### Activity: Prepositions Computer Game (20 minutes)
Play in teams (one team out of the classroom) as done recently, check [[English Class 6#Activity Interactive Review (10 min)|how we conducted the game]].  Each team 2 students. The highest scoring team wins. Track time to resolve tie results.

### Activity: Placing Items Around (30 min)
Have two teams with 3 members. All team members can discus together, but one player is the one who will perform the action. Active player can be marked with a ==balloon== attached on him.

With the prepositions projected on screen, say sentences like "Put the pen inside the teacher's bag.". If the students miss vocabulary, draw the item in the whiteboard.

## 4. Video Games (10 min)
Cash out the ==point== holders and play video games. Limit it to only 2 rounds of playing, that is, cashing out 4 tickets (since 2 students play at once in my case, it's a game with 2 game controllers).

Also because recently they have not been playing, and that way the motivation might still get sustained to keep them motivated after the difficulty of earning points has increased.
