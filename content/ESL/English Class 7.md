## 2. Video Games (10 min)
Cash out the ==point== holders and play video games. Just see how it affects the dynamics of the class. Limit it to only 2 rounds of playing, that is, cashing out 4 tickets (since 2 students play at once in my case, it's a game with 2 game controllers).

Also because recently they have not been playing, and that way the motivation might still get sustained to keep them motivated after the difficulty of earning points has increased.

## 3. Review Body Parts (20 min)
### Activity: Touching Something With Body Part (21 min)
Play with 2 teams of 3 players each.

The active player must carry the ==balloon== attached to their body (e.g. wrist), that adds a visual element that's fun and entertaining to see.

The teacher will reveal three sentences like:
- Touch a pen with your left foot.
- Touch a window with your left foot.
- Touch a head with your nose. 

And one by one the students need to perform these actions while the teacher **keeps track of time**.

The winner is the team that finished them the fastest.

Elements to play with:
- Classroom items: pen, pencil, floor, whiteboard, door, desk, chair, book, curtain, window, tv, computer, ...
- Body parts: head, finger, hand, feet, elbow, knee, ...

> 21 minutes = 3 games of 7 minutes (each player gets 2 minutes).

### Activity: Placing Items Around (30 min)
Have two teams with 3 members. All team members can discus together, but one player is the one who will perform the action. Active player can be marked with a ==balloon== attached on him.

With the prepositions projected on screen, say sentences like "Put the pen inside the teacher's bag.". If the students miss vocabulary, draw the item in the whiteboard.
