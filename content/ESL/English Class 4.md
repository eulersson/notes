[[English Beginner Classes]]
<< [[English Class 3]] | [[English Class 5]] >>

This class I want to relax a bit from doing interactive activities and try to see how we can follow the book more and how to do teaching with a text book that has such loose exercises. If the exercises are done swiftly, play some Magic English.

## Learning Goals
- I, you, he / she / it, we, you, they.
- Actions: read, stand, chase, eat, jump, sit.
- Imperative, only say the verb.
- Continuous: -ing, if it's happening right now.

## Material
- [ ] Laptop and projector or screen.
- [ ] Bag with the vocabulary words (16).

## 1. Refresh: Vocabulary (Anki) (20 min)
- Animals
- Emotions

## 2. Pronouns
I, you, he / she / it, we, you, they

Very nice interactive YouTube videos:
- [Subject Pronouns | I, you, we, they, he, she, it | Game | Learn English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31CBj4gMVfI)
- [I, you, we, they, he, she, it | Game for kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNE3hcHhnkc)

Now write the pronouns at the board and have them copy. Write them with little drawings showing singular or plural (be creative, maybe some single dot on the singular and many dots on the plural).

> [!INFO] Anki
> Add those words as flashcards for refreshing.

## 3. Verbs (Infinitive and Continuous) (30 min)

### Explain (20 min)

We will work on the following verbs. No need to whiteboard them yet.

| read     | stand    | chase     | eat        |
| -------- | -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **jump** | **sit**  | **talk**  | **put on** |
| **get**  | **fly**  | **point** | **look**   |
| **play** | **draw** | **brush** | **sweep**  |

> [!NOTE] Anki
> Add those words to the Anki deck for memorizing!

## Activity: Acting (10 min)
Getting the imperative (play) and continuous form (playing), practicing dictation at the same time. Give points to the volunteers.
- Student gets selected.
- Student pulls a paper verb from the bag.
- Student spells it in front of the class while other students write it down.
- Other students read the word aloud together without spelling after the 3-2-1 from the teacher.
- Teachers says an imperative action that involve other objects too so they get familiarized with real sentences:
	- you ==read== a book
	- ==stand== on the cushion
	- ==chase== me
	- ==eat== your finger
	- ==jump== a little bit (a lot)
	- ==sit== on the chair
- The student performs it and while it performs asks the other students "What ==is he== doing?", and they reply "He ==is talking==."
- The teacher can also put the student under test to perform the action with others and do the action collectively so the teacher asks "What ==are they== doing?", and students reply "==They are== talking.", instead of "What ==is he doing?==.". Also you can ask the student to say "What ==am I doing==?" while performing the actions. All this is to drill the **subject pronouns.**
