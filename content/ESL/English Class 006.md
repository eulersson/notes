## 1. Refresh Vocabulary (Anki) (20 min)
Since we start to have many words, speed up the process by speaking aloud instead of having the student to type.

Now we get more strict: if player gets more than 50% (roughly, make it clear before the exercise) of the words right, gets ==1 point==. We are not so benevolent as before, where only getting one spelling right gives you a point!

Also since I have 3 whiteboards available I will get three more students to do the test ==simultaneously==. It's important that they see the image but they don't see what the others are typing. As teacher, when the computer student reveals the result, I will mark the others with a âœ…. The rest of students type on their notebooks.

> [!WARN] No Points
> If nobody gets points then the player that scored the most points gets one, despite not having reached the threshold.

| Set        | Way         | Points         |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Animals    | Speak aloud | No             |
| Verbs      | Speak aloud | No             |
| Body parts | Type        | Yes if 3 right |
| Directions | Type        | Yes if 4 right |

## 2. Body Parts (20 min)

### Activity: Interactive Review (10 min)
**Set 1** in [Games to Learn English | Body Parts](https://www.gamestolearnenglish.com/body-parts/#review). First review them on screen, drilling them, it's a nice interactive game!

Refresh the ones we know (arm, finger, knee, elbow, foot) and introduce new ones from **Set 1**:
- head
- body
- arm
- hand
- leg
- foot

Let's make a competition. Make 2 teams of 2 players each. You will play the game for **Set 1** with ==one team inside the room==, and then when finish write down the score in the whiteboard. Write the score on board. Afterwards, get the ==second team comes into the room== and will try to beat that score for **Set 1**. **Track time** too so if they score the same value you can easily choose the winner.

Give ==points== to the winning team members.

> [!TODO] Anki
> Add those extra vocabulary pieces into the Anki deck for next class.

## 3. Prepositions (10 min)
### Explain (15 min)
Show the picture below and draw a simpler one in the whiteboard that they must copy without the 3D depth of the cube. Students must ==copy== them down and study for next class.


> [!DANGER] Drawing
> I noticed the drawings from the students were poor. It's better to print out and hand them a copy of the drawing. I made it so two fit in one page and you can download it here: [[Prepositions of Place Sheet for Students]]

Explain each one by using any item from the class room and placing them in relation to another object.

![[Prepositions of Place.jpg]]

- above / below (no direct contact)
- over / under (direct contact)
- behind / in front of
- near / far from
- top / middle / bottom
- next to
- in
- on
- between


> [!WARNING] Out of Time
> If running out of time, leave it here and ask the students to memorize those words for tomorrow.
