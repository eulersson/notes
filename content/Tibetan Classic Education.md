The monks from [[Amithaba Monastery]] (*kagyupa* tradition) usually are sent to **Central Insitute of [[Tibetan]] Higher Studies** at **Sarnath, Varanasi** after class 8.

So first usually they start with UKG སྔོན་འགྲོའི་སློབ་གྲྭ།, then Primary School གཞི་རིམ་སློབ་གྲྭ། (year 1 to 8).

Then they join what would be the equivalent of "college" བཤད་གྲྭ།. In there they study Buddhist philosophy, logic, and various classical texts:
- Purva Madhyama དགུ་མ་འོག་མ། (2 years)
- Uttara Madhyama དགུ་མ་དགོང་མ། (2 years)
- Shastri བསྙན་བཅོས། (3 years)
- Acharya སློབ་དཔོན། (2 years)

Then after that if you have gotten distinction you are encouraged to follow towards *geshe* / *khempo* རིག་གཅིག་རྐང་འཛིན། (specialize in one subject) degree which involves 3 years of research into a topic (sort of a PhD).

If you don't get distinction you go serve to a monastery and later on with time you might acquire it if in that monastery during your service you did some study.
