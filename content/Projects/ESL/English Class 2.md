## 1. Refresh: Alphabet + Numbers (10 min)
Make a big circle with students standing up and holding hands. Then each student places the hand on top of the other, and they have to clap their way through the alphabet, that is, I clap the person next to me on the left after saying the letter. And then numbers from 30 to 0.

## 2. Capital Letters & Small Letters Make Words (20 min)
*[[Headway English Grammar and Composition 1|Grammar and Composition]] page 8, 9, 10.*

Explain letters combined make words, not not all group of letters are words. A word must have a meaning.

### Activity: Changing from Capital to Small Letter (5 min)
Teacher holds one of the portable boards, and a student is selected, and receives the other portable board. The teacher writes a word in CAPITALS and all the students write it in small letters, or vice-versa. Then I get the student board and I check with the rest of the class if it's correct or not.

### Activity: Is This a Word? (5 min)
Write in the portable whiteboard one word and ask if they think it's a word or not. Do the same with gibberish words. Let them pass the balloon to select upcoming players.

### Work: Changing from Capital to Small Letter (2.5 min)

## 3.  Vocabulary: Lion King (30 min)

Play *I Just Can't Wait to be King* ([YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHxCIQuWDd0)) of the traditional animation.

First play the entire video to not disrupt the flow of the animation.

> [!NOTE] On Whiteboard
> How many \_\_\_ are there?
> There is \_\_\_ \_\_\_.
> There are \_\_\_ \_\_\_.

During the second play of the video pause and also ask "What is this animal?", and they reply "This is a monkey.". Also ask "Is it an elephant?", and they must answer "No, it's not an elephant", etc. And also reinforce the counting "How many birds are there?", "There are 4 birds".

The name of the animals will be collected and studied: ^f40775
- elephant
- ostrich
- giraffe
- gorilla
- rhino
- zebra
- hippo
- leopard
- monkey

> [!TODO] Anki Deck
> Create flashcards for those learn words into an Anki Deck, the app for making your own flash cards (text-to-text, image-to-text, or whatever! You design them with HTML, so complete freedom).

At the end: Two volunteers, one has to formulate sentence "How many rhinos are there?" and the other needs to answer, "There is one rhino". Time to introduce the **only** word. "There is ==only== one rhino". They get ==point==!

Now work on the ==translation== of the words collected from the video into their native language (ideally would be nice to draw the concept, but we can't afford so much time). Tell them you will ask them with images tomorrow, so they need to study. Ask volunteers to draw on the whiteboard (4 and 4). They get ==point==.
