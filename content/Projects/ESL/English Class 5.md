Two games in one! memo & buy and sell

memo game:

- Draw 7 fruits (apple, pear, grapes, lemon, pepper, banana, carrot) on the blackboard and place number and spelling on it on the blackboard.
- Drill those words.
- Assign a number to each student, and they will have to draw that fruit in a paper and copy the name in another paper, so each student produces two snips.
- Collect them. and write 1-7 on drawings and a-g onn the spellings.
- Mix, mix, mix the drawings.
- Mix, mix, mix the spellings.
- With bluetack stick the spellings on the left part of the board facing against it so nothing can be seen, and place the drawings on the other.
- Memo game! Split the group in two and taking turns the add points on a counter if they manage to find the matching pairs of drawings and spellings. They will have to shout the number on the paper so I turn it to reveal the drawing/spelling.
