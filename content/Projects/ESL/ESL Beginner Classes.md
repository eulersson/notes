## Selection Methods and Reward System
Sometimes instead of having to randomly select choices or players (which I struggle with) it's better to have some physical activity such as the ones listed below.

> [!INFO] Volunteering Students
> There might be students that want to volunteer for the activity (specially when a reward system is in place). It's nice to interoperate between asking for volunteers for the activity and randomly selecting one tossing the balloon as follows.


| Name                                                                  | Image                             | Method                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Drawn Balloon                                                         | ![[Drawn Balloon.excalidraw.png]] | Inflate a balloon or a ball and paint symbols or numbers across the same longitude, drawing wedges vertically (meridians). Toss the balloon randomly or aim it towards shy students and the meridian the right thumb of the hand lands on that one is the number that's used.<br><br>The balloon's purpose is twofold:<br>- Selects a **student** and...<br>- ...  selects a **choice** that can map to something in the activity.<br> |
| [Origami Fortune Teller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAhiIlTxUYA) | ![[Origami Fortune Teller.png]]   | For working with pairs, one student says the number in English, the other student performs the alternating vertical and horizontal opens until the number is reached and then a letter must be read.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [Origami Dice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hA1BKyx5lA)           | ![[Origami Dice.png]]             | Simply roll the dice. It's fun because they have made the origami cube themselves! And it's also an inflatable balloon! Follow the balloon tutorial and give it hard edges and you have a dice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Big Flipping Coin                                                     | ![[Cardboard Disk.png]]           | Just to select among two values. For instance if you want a student to say a sentence in positive or negative, this might come useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

> [!INFO] 
> Before class if you get time to spend with the students a good ice-breaker to get to know them good is to elaborate and produce those paper figures **Origami Fortune Teller** and **Origami Dice**.

To encourage them to participate a reward system might be suitable: **1 point if they participate** and **1 extra point if they get the answer right**.

This [VR roller coaster](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/roller-coaster-vr-theme-park/id1029391378?l=en-GB) game (you can buy the plastic case for 3-4 dollars and use your phone as screen) or offering the student with most points to go to roller skate, bumper cars or something that's also fun for you, teacher!
