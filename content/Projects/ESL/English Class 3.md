### Activity: Emotions Board Memo (10min)
Memo game on the whiteboard covering the emojis and the emotion names.

**Setup:**
	- On the **whiteboard**
		- Draw those emotions, and also their names.
		- Write "How are you?" or "How do you feel?"
		- Write "Are you \_\_\_?" or “Do you feel \_\_\?”
- Cover all images and words with numbered papers (1–16, shuffled).

**How to Play:**
- Students call out 2 numbers (e.g., “3 and 12”), in English!
- Uncover both
	- if it’s a match, they earn 1 point.
	- if it's not a match they toss the balloon around.
- Ask what is the name in Nepali.
- Ask: "Are you \_\_\_?", “Do you feel \_\_\?” as you point to whiteboard.
- Student replies: “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t.”

Students get ==1 point== for this and ==1 extra== if they did acting.

### Activity: Emotions Balloon (10min)
Balloon-select the participants. Then select another student to ask the question "How do you feel?" and the balloon-selected person replies:

- I feel tired (5), and if it acts it then gets ==1 point==.

Write the sentence on whiteboard as you say it, and the pairing sentence as the student replies.
