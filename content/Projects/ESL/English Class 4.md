[[English Beginner Classes]]
<< [[English Class 3]] | [[English Class 5]] >>

This class I want to relax a bit from doing interactive activities and try to see how we can follow the book more and how to do teaching with a text book that has such loose exercises. If the exercises are done swiftly, play some Magic English.

## Learning Goals
- I, you, he / she / it, we, you, they.
- Actions: read, stand, chase, eat, jump, sit.
- Imperative, only say the verb.
- Continuous: -ing, if it's happening right now.
- Writing misc. vocabulary from activity book.

## Material
- Bag with the vocabulary words (16).

## 2. Pronouns
I, you, he / she / it, we, you, they

Very nice interactive YouTube videos:
- [Subject Pronouns | I, you, we, they, he, she, it | Game | Learn English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31CBj4gMVfI)
- [I, you, we, they, he, she, it | Game for kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNE3hcHhnkc)

Now write the pronouns at the board and have them copy. Write them with little drawings showing singular or plural (be creative, maybe some single dot on the singular and many dots on the plural).

> Add those words as flashcards for refreshing.

## Activity: Acting (10 min)
- Student gets selected.

- Student spells it and reads it.
- Teachers says an imperative action
	- read a book
	- stand on the cushion
	- chase me
	- eat your finger
	- jump a little bit (a lot)

- As you say the imperative write it on whiteboard.
