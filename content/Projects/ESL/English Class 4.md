[[English Beginner Classes]]
<< [[English Class 3]] | [[English Class 5]] >>

This class I want to relax a bit from doing interactive activities and try to see how we can follow the book more and how to do teaching with a text book that has such loose exercises. If the exercises are done swiftly, play some Magic English.

## Learning Goals
- Actions: read, stand, chase, eat, jump, sit.
- Imperative, only say the verb.
- Continuous: -ing, if it's happening right now.
- Writing misc. vocabulary from activity book.

## 1. Refresh: Vocabulary (20 min)
- Anki
	- Animals
	- Emotions

---

## 2. Imperative and Continuous (30 min)

### Explain (20 min)
Actions or verbs:
- read / reading
- stand / standing
- chase / chasing
- eat / eating
- jump / jumping
- sit / sitting

> [!NOTE] Anki
> Add those words to the Anki deck for memorizing!

Have them copy those words and write translations.

Ask students to read / stand (on the floor) / chase (me) / eat  / jump / sit with the balloon technique. And when the action is going say "What is he doing?", and then everyone has to say "He is reading, standing, chasing me, eating candy".
