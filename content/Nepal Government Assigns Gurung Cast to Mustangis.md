Each cast is reflected into the person's surname in their IDs, so I had the question on why Mustangis do not have it in their names. [[Rigzin Gurung Lama]] told me it's because when Nepal government assigned the territory to Nepal it gave it the cast "Gurung" for some reason I still need to find out.

It seems that it's a requirement for each ethnic group to be reflected into a cast and have that cast reflected in the name of the individual.

Rigzin does not know but after speaking to some monks it seems it might be a twofold political reason. But they are not too sure either, so don't take this as true:

1. The Gurung cast is large and very nationalistic for Nepal, so there might be an interest for Nepal to claim them as a strongly Nepali cast. Remember that Nepal conquered Mustang after all!
2. If you give it a small cast, China could swallow it up, since it's in the very border.

So to me it feels like a twofold blessing-and-curse for Mustangis. One thing is for sure that they take healthy pride of being Mustangis, they don't say a vague "Oh, Gurung is fine, whatever."
