One ། (ཤད་) is for separating sentences. Two ། ། is more for separating paragraphs or parts of a poem. And four ། ། ། ། is for the final ending. Sometimes when there's no new lines in the text and they are inline, it looks each sentence is wrapped between ། but it's not! There's never one in front; they are the ones from the previous element.
For respect you start text with ༄༅ ། ། and also the ༈ has the same meaning but the monks told me you select one or the other usually based on the [[Tibetan Script]].
