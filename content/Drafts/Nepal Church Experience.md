It was wonderful to witness Christian services in Nepal. I felt very welcomed by father Dha. He was introduced to me by one of the [[Pema Tsal]] staff members.

The service was emotionally charged and with lots of music and talent!

The assistants integrated me so well. I remember the old lady next to me treating me like I was her son, with physical contact, holding my hands, and so on.
