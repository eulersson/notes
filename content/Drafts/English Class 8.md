### Activity: Small Dialog (20 min)
Get a student pair, they will get ==points== regardless of their performance.

They need to go through the entire dialog in the [[#Explain (15 min)]] section. It's OK if they read from the whiteboard.

When it comes to choosing the emotion or the action:
- **The emotion is acted by the teacher.** Then the student that replies needs to say it loud and act it.
- The action is whispered and written by the teacher in small whiteboard. Then the student acts and the person asking has to say **You are ...**.
