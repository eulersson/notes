One big **issue** with the language is how hard is to look up words if you don't know their spelling. **It would be amazing to have a phonetic reverse search dictionary**, that is **you type with phonetic transcription**, and then **it presents all the possible spellings**. Does this exist? Investigate! Otherwise it would be an amazing technical project to work on!

So I decided to write email to *Monlam AI* (hello@monlam.ai)

> Hello བཀྲ་ཤིས་བདེ་ལེགས།
> I am a Tibetan language student and I am struggling a lot when I find a word in spoken language that I am unaware of.
> Of course it can be joloked, but I thought another good idea is to be able to lookup the word in the dictionary without knowing the spelling.
> To me in spoken contexts having a dictionary is useless unless they jolok a lot.
> So it would have a lot of value to do searches based on the sound and not the spelling, **for example, a spoken word that starts with a sound like ཆ་ (Wylie: cha) would look for ཆ་ (Wylie: cha) and ཕྱ་ (Wylie: phya). So you only have to worry about typing “cha”.**
> Three of my fellow student friends agreed it would be very useful!
> Have you ever thought about this?
