These sentences have been translated with the help of AI (Claude) by making explicit request to do it colloquial.

1. When is it going to be finished?
	1. ག་དུས་ ཚར་གྱི་རེད། 
2. Have you already added sugar to my tea?
	1. ཁྱེད་རང་ངའི་ཇ་ནང་ལ་ཀ་ར་བླུགས་ཚར་པས།

This is the context I introduced under *Settings > Preferences*:
> Every time I ask you to translate from Tibetan always give to me in Colloquial Style, not literary.
> Tibetan translations always separating words with spaces because I am learning and that way I can see where one word ends and other starts.
> When transcribing Tibetan phonetically always use Lotsawa House style, that is: space between words so words can be identified, and using "é" instead of "ey". Claude mostly by default does this already.
> When asking for breakdowns, between parenthesis don't give me the Wylie transliteration, instead give me the one I mentioned in the preferences, just on the previous sentence. Make sure to honour the requirement of not having space inbetween the same word.
