	- It's a very nice ice breaker! It takes one or two games to fully grasp the dynamics and  it has the right mix between luck and strategy.
- Throw Throw Burrity
	- Lots of laughter and physical activity. Less strategy and more skills related to fast processing!
- Ultimate Werewolf
	- Fantastic for developing skills to hide your emotions and deceive others that you are not the wolf! It's more about dialoguing and convincing others rather than the actual physical game elements themselves. I play it with low light, a small torch and ambiance music.

	- Isreaeli kids in [[Pema Tsal]] taught me and other monks how to play and it's easy to understand and so much fun!
